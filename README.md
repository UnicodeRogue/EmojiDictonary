# EmojiDictonary
An emoji saves you so much typing :tada:

This dictonary comes from me noticing how emoji are used to convey a fair amount of information at GitHub. Some of that isn't necessarily intuitive, and plus I like gathering information 


| Emoji  | Official name   | Usecase  | Topical area  | Cultural reference  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
